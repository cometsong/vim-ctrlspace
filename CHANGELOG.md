# Current version changes can be found in the 

# Version 5

Vim-CtrlSpace started over 6 years ago as a fork of [another
plugin](https://github.com/roblillack/vim-bufferlist) and the Version
**5** is the result of the experience gained during that period and
cooperation with the community.

Version 5 is the biggest upgrade in the plugin history. All plugin code
has been rewritten from scratch taking user feedback as a great resource
of ideas and challenges into account. Thanks to users the plugin has
configurable key mappings and allows you to handle projects with **100
000** files!

In case you're curious, Vim-CtrlSpace 5 took *@szw* 5 months of spare evenings
to complete :).

The most exciting **Vim-CtrlSpace 5** features are:

  * better, modular, and extensible code base
  * simplified, well thought-out, and clear design
  * new fuzzy search engine for files (written in Go)
  * more effective and responsive behavior
  * fine-grained configuration

Version 5 is not backward compatible. All configuration variables and API
functions have been renamed. Please check Vim help for more info:
```VimL
:help ctrlspace-configuration
```
